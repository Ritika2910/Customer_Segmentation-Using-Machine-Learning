**🚀 Project Overview**

This project focuses on customer segmentation using machine learning techniques to categorize customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior.

**🔍 Key Features**

1. Data Preprocessing & Analysis: Cleaned, transformed, and analyzed data to extract meaningful insights for targeted marketing.
2. Customer Segmentation Model: Developed a data-driven clustering model to identify 5 distinct customer groups within the dataset.
3. Optimization & Performance Tuning: Fine-tuned model parameters iteratively, improving segmentation accuracy by 20%.

**📊 Clustering Techniques**

*📌 K-Means Clustering*

✅ Partitioned customers into k distinct clusters based on similarities.

✅ Used Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.

✅ Improved segmentation accuracy by adjusting cluster centroids iteratively.

*📌 DBSCAN Clustering*

✅ Identified density-based clusters of customers with arbitrary shapes.

✅ No need to predefine the number of clusters.

✅ Used epsilon (ε) and minimum points to define core points and outliers.

✅ Effective in detecting noise and outlier customers.

✅ Achieved a Silhouette Score of 0.41 for well-defined clusters.
